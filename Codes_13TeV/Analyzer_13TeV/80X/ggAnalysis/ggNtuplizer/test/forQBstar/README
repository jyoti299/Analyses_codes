First week of January:::: submitting crab jobs with the following settings and datasets.
*****************************************
::::::::::Datasets and settings::::::::::
**********Datasets***********************
Refer to twiki: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookMiniAOD
DATA: Re-Reco-BCDEFG+PromptReco-H (will be changed in next iteration for Moriond17)
MC: RunIISpring16MiniAODv2-PUSpring16_80X_mcRun2_asymptotic_2016_miniAODv2_v0/MINIAODSIM
(The MC sample right now recommended are Spring16 ones, however, for Moriond17, the recommended are Summer16 samples which will be used later on 
when these will be asked and recommended to use.)
***********Global tags*******************
Refer to twiki: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookMiniAOD
DATA GT: 80X_dataRun2_2016SeptRePro_v4
MC GT: 80X_mcRun2_asymptotic_2016_miniAODv2

***********JSON**************************
Refer to twiki: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/PdmV2016Analysis.
Announcement of latest json: https://mmm.cern.ch/owa/?ae=Item&a=Open&t=IPM.Note&id=RgAAAAAVYcc7ugiYQoBqvGptA5XEBwCB90QqZNMdSZ%2fbaeqz89oLAAAg%2fXNAAACB90QqZNMdSZ%2fbaeqz89oLAADX9I91AAAA&pspid=_1483510466997_759531507.
This corresponds to a total lumi of 36.46/fb

**********JetEnergyCorrections***********
Refer to twiki: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/JECDataMC
The jet energy corrections used in this set is : Spring16_23Sep2016AllV2_DATA for data
and Spring16_25nsV10_MC for MC using sqlite files.
This will be updated further and will have to be changed accordingly.

The jer info is being added into the code in CMSSW_8_0_24_patch1. However, these scale factors are for ICHEP only and new factors will be available
soon and so I will have to update it. 

*********Photon energy scale and resolution*****
Refer to twiki: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/EGMSmearer

The code including it is updated in CMSSW_8_0_24_patch1
However, these corrections are still for ICHEP and will be updated.

*********Solution for Slew-Rate problem in photons*****
The solution for this is given in EGMSmearer twiki under section: ECAL scale and resolution corrections for Moriond 2017 (preliminary version)
under NOTE.
I have added these corrections also in CMSSW_8_0_24_patch1. and made two new branches with these corrections.
