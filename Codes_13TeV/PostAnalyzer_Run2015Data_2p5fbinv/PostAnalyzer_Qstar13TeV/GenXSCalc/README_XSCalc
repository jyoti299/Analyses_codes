####HOW TO CALCULATE THE CROSS SECTION FOR A PARTICUALR SAMPLE: WHAT SETUP I HAVE DONE HERE###

HERE GJets_Datasets.txt, QCDDiJet_Datasets.txt, QstarSignal_Datasets.txt and BstarSignal_Datasets.txt FILES CONTAINS NAMES OF ALL
THE CORRESPONDING DATASETS. THESE NEED NOT TO BE COPIED BY HAND. JUST RUN THE COMMAND (EG FOR BSTAR)

./das_client.py --query="dataset=/BstarToGJ_M-*_f-*_TuneCUETP8M1_13TeV-pythia8/RunIISpring15DR74-Asympt25ns_MCRUN2_74_V9-v*/MINIAODSIM" --limit=0 >> BstarSignal_Datasets.txt 

AND IT WILL COPY ALL THE DATA MATCHING THIS QUERY INTO THE OUPTUT FILE.

NOW GIVE THE NAME OF THIS DATASET INTO THE run_ana.py SCRIPT AND RUN IT, IT WILL TAKE THE NAME OF EACH DATASET AND TAKE OUT 30 FILES FOR THIS USING
COMMAND

./das_client.py --query="file dataset= ${datsetname here}" --limit=${nFiles} > DAS_out
and tail -n +4 DAS_out > Input.txt (THIS TO REMOVE FIRST FOUR IRREVALANT LINES)

AND IT WILL CALCULATE THE XS FOR THESE FILES USING THE COMMAND

cmsRun ana.py inputFiles="file:xxx.root" maxEvents=-1 

AND WILL REDIRECT THE OUTPUT INTO AN OUTPUT FILE.

SO JUST GIVE THE NAME OF THE DATASET AND RUN THIS SCRIPT AND ALL THE CROSS SECTION OUTPUTS WILL BE IN THE XSOutput_$Dataset FILE 
ALONG WITH THE LINE

After filter: final cross-section

AND IN ORDER TO RUN THE CONDOR JOBS:
JUST TAKE THE run_ana.sh AND MakeCondorFiles.csh, DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING IN THESE, THESE WILL WORK FOR ALL DATASETS, JUST GIVE THE NAME OF THE 
DATASET AS ${1} WHILE SUBMITTING THE CONDOR JOBS. 
SO TO RUN THE CONDOR JOBS:

JUST DO
./MakeCondorFiles.csh Dataset_name
FOR EXAMPLE, FOR GJETS DATASET:
DO
./MakeCondorFiles.csh GJets_Datasets.txt

ALSO, IN run_Seperate DIR, THERE IS ANOTHER WAY IS DEFINED IN WHICH WE SEPEARTELY TAKE THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF FILES FOR EACH DATASET FROM DAS USING
run_das.sh AND THEN WILL RUN THE ana.py USING run_ana.sh.
